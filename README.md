# Hosts

`hosts` is a command line program for managing [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_\(file\)) entries.

`hosts` works with existing hosts files and entries, making it easier to add, remove, comment, and search hosts file entries using simple, memorable commands.

## Installation

### Homebrew

To install with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew tap alphabetum/taps && brew install alphabetum/taps/hosts
```

### bpkg

To install with [bpkg](http://www.bpkg.io/):

```bash
bpkg install alphabetum/hosts
```

### Manual

To install manually, simply add the `hosts` script to your `$PATH`. If
you already have a `~/bin` directory, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.github.com/alphabetum/hosts/master/hosts \
  -o ~/bin/hosts && chmod +x ~/bin/hosts
```

A package for Arch users is also [available in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hosts/).
